# NeonTanks

## Background and Overview

NeonTanks is a visually appealing projectile game, inspired by GunBound and ShellShock Live. The goal is to play against an AI tank neon projectiles and win!


## Functionality and MVP Features
* [ ] Users will be able to move their tank and shoot projectile (Physics calculated to create a projectile arc)
* [ ] Projectiles will deal damange to enemies
* [ ] Enemies will have hit boxes and damage taken will be recorded
* [ ] Score will be displayed at the end of the level
* [ ] Collisions will be circle spirals and and death particles will also be in place
* [ ] Tank movement will have sound, collisions will have sound, and explosions 
* [ ] AI will be able to fire back more accurately with increasing difficultly of levels

### Bonus 
* [ ] Randomly spawned bonuses that will increase the damage and look of the projectiles 
* [ ] Users can choose their own tanks that shoot different geometric projectiles


## Architecture and Technologies
    * Javascript for the game logic 
    * HTML5 Canvas for rendering 
    * Web Audio API for rendering background music and collision sounds 
## Implementation Timeline
    * Day 1: Learn the basic physics necessary for tank movement and create canvas background and assets
    * Day 2: Create the shooting mechanics / physics for the tanks 
    * Day 3: Handling the enemy hitboxes and collisions
    * Day 4: Change the background based on how collisions occur
    * Day 5: Adding sound to the tank movement, explosions, and 
    * Day 6: Creating a game menu for start, pause, and score 
    * Day 7: AI will be able to make approximate guesses against player
